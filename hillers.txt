the official hillers system

i am TIRED of having to use kilobytes, kibibytes, blablablabytes, theyre all just so fucking confusing.

besides, the bytes system is rlly unstable flimsy.
i see kilobytes as 1000 bytes in one source, and some other says 1024, so yk.

i am going to make this as straightforward as possible.

1. the fun size!

first up, we have bytes. a byte is a single ascii characters. a byte consists of two nybbles, and a nybble consists of four bits which have a binary 0/1 state.

then we have a single microhiller, marked as Î¼H or uH. a microhiller has 19 bytes. why? because i fucking said so.

then after a microhiller, comes a hiller, marked as H. a hiller has 4 microhillers, or 76 bytes. coolio!

then come...

2. the small guys.

fuck it im doing this as a list now:

mH: macrohiller, which is 8 hillers
kH: kilohiller, 10 macrohillers
hH: har(monic)hiller, 4 kilohillers (i just wanted to have hh)
wH: wowhiller, 20 harhillers

3. the bigger fellas

tH: terahiller, 20 wowhillers.
qH: qwenhiller, 5 terahillers.
